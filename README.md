# containers
Implementation of STL library containers.

Example implementation of the following containers:
- [stack](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/container/stack)
- [vector](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/container/vector)
- [map](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/container/map)

Additionally implemented, [conditional](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/types/conditional), 
[enable_if](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/types/enable_if), [less](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/utility/functional/less), 
[pair](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/utility/pair), 
[iterator_traits](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/iterator/iterator_traits), 
[bidirectional iterator (for trees)](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/named_req/BidirectionalIterator), 
[random access iterator](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/named_req/RandomAccessIterator),
[reverse iterator](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/iterator/reverse_iterator).

A binary search tree is used as the data structure for the map.
